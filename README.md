# Toggle Themes
This project that I created was for me to learn to change themes in a website, nowdays seen in many websites. What I wanted to learn through this project is to be able to create a dropdown menu using only css, and a obviously to change theme and store it in local storage. So when a user a desirable theme, that theme must be there even after the page reloads or when user comes back to site.
Later, I want to make it automatic so during night-time dark theme displays and during day-time light theme displays. But that can be overwrite if user selects a theme.
